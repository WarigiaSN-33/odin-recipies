        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 New York Strip Steaks 1 pound and 1 1/4″ thick</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
            <li>Quartered garlic cloves</li>
            <li>Rosemary</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pat dry – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and
                reduce oil splatter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season generously – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides
                liberally with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil
                reduces splatter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown
                crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear
                edges (1 min per edge).
            </li>
            <li>
                Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and
                rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to
                your desired doneness.
            </li>
            <li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
        </ol>
